## [Visit SNEAKERHEADS Here](https://sneakerheads.fly.dev/)
SNEAKERHEADS is an online platform that allows users to log & manage their sneaker collection, connect with other 'sneakerhead' users, and provide an outlet to buy or sell new or used sneakers. 

SNEAKERHEADS is inspired by my friends that have stacks and stacks of shoeboxes in their homes. I wanted to give them a 3-in-1 app to help manage, grow, or even decrease their sneaker collection. Sneakers are an art form! So if the shoe fits ... wear it, catalog it, and share it!
