What is a sneakerhead? "A person who collects and trades sneakers as a hobby, and who typically is knowledgeable about the history of sneakers." - [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sneakerhead#:~:text=noun%20Slang.,ANSWER%20THESE%20COMMON%20GRAMMAR%20DEBATES%3F)

SNEAKERHEADS is an online platform that allows users to log & manage their sneaker collection, connect with other 'sneakerhead' users, and provide an outlet to buy or sell new or used sneakers. 

SNEAKERHEADS is inspired by my friends that have stacks and stacks of shoeboxes in their homes. I wanted to give them a 3-in-1 app to help manage, grow, or even decrease their sneaker collection. After all, it is an art form!
