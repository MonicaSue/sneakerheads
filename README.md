## [Visit SNEAKERHEADS Here]()

SNEAKERHEADS is inspired by my friends that have stack and stacks of shoeboxes in their homes. I wanted to give them an app to track their sneakers digitally and give them a place to connect with the 'sneakerhead' community. This online platform will also allow them to increase or decrease their shoe collection through SNEAKERHEADS' Marketplace.
