## [Visit SNEAKERHEADS Here]()

SNEAKERHEADS is inspired by my friends that have stack and stacks of shoeboxes in their homes. I wanted to give them an app to track their sneakers digitally and give them a place to connect with the 'sneakerhead' community. This online platform will also allow them to increase or decrease their shoe collection through SNEAKERHEADS' Marketplace. 

Planning materials and original wireframes can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/zgSVJvGE/sneakerheads)
